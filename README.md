### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm Yuchen, a junior full-stack developer with a background in Communication.** Graduated from Le Wagon 6-month Web Development Bootcamp recently.

After obtaining bachelor's degree in China, I went to the UK for master's degree in Media and Public Relations. In 2021, I decided to move to Paris and explore the career of tech world. At the beginning, I took this as a challenge to myself to see if I can break through self-imposed limitations and insist on studying about tech things after so many years studying in an irrelevent field, but in this process, I found that web development is attractive to me. After learning coding, I feel like some excited thing will happen every time when I open the code editor, so I knew that I have the right direction.

ðŸŽ¨I'm currently trying to gain more solid understanding of Ruby and JavaScript, and can't wait to dive into more frameworks and programming languages such as React and Python.


### Here are some projects I worked on:

[PAWS](http://www.pawbypaw.me/) - A web app which aims to forge enduring bonds between pets in need and caring families throughout Europe.

[Nook Coworking](https://airbnb-innaziuko.herokuapp.com/) - A simple AirBnB clone project to rent co-working space.
